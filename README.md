# Car-Parking-SQLite

Car Parking Automation

The name, surname, plate and entrance time of the customer entering the parking lot are recorded in the SQLite database. It has the process of showing, updating,

deleting and searching the cars in the parking lot. When the car leaves the parking lot, the difference between the entrance time and the exit is calculated and

the price that it has to pay is calculated (30 TL per hour, therefore 0.5 TL per minute is taken). Since the car exits, price information is given and the customer 

record is deleted.
